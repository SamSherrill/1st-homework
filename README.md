Completed 1st Homework -- Horiseon Code Refactoring

I'm excited to return this refactored code to you! I have:

1. Made sure the layout appears on the web exactly the same.
2. Added alt text to all images for accessibility.
3. Changed HTML divs to semantic elements wherever possible.
4. Made the CSS more efficient. This was accomplished by:
    a. Styling HTML semantic elements.
    b. Styling the HTML elements instead of using classes everywhere allowed me to delete many classes altogether.
    c. Combined & renamed classes whenever possible.
5. Changed title tag to be more appropriate & SEO-optimized for Horiseon's business goals.
6. Left comments in the HTML for future reference.
