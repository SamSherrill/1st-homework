# 1st-homework

I added some returns in the code to make it more obvious which sections are separated from others.

Combined classes. Deleted some unnecessary ids and/or classes that were redundant / useless. I referenced those sections of code to classes/ids that were already in use, or new ones that I created to condense the code, while still staying true to the original style.
